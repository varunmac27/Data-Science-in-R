# Data-Science-in-R

# Decision Tree Practice
- Computed Gini index and information gain manually for creating decision trees to understand the underlying concept
- Creating C&R trees and C5 trees in R with the given dataset using rpart and ctree libraries
- Controlled tree parameters using cp, minbucket, minsplit and maxdepth in list=parms()function. 

# Bagging and Random Forest Practice
- Computing Confusion Matrix, ROC curve, AUC and understanding Specifity and Sensitivity concepts
- Understanding general classifiers and creating random forest and bagging models to outperform the general classifier
- Created tree using tree() function and prunes using prune() function to bootstrap multiple trees to aggregate
