# Bagging and Random Forest Practice
- Computing Confusion Matrix, ROC curve, AUC and understanding Specifity and Sensitivity concepts
- Understanding general classifiers and creating random forest and bagging models to outperform the general classifier
- Created tree using tree() function and prunes using prune() function to bootstrap multiple trees to aggregate
